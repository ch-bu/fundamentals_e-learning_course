Video: Die Forschungslage zu problembasierten Lernen ist dicker als bei den Goal-Based Scenarios. Die Studien zeigen, dass problembasiertes Lernen nicht effektiver ist lehrerzentrierte Formate, wenn es darum geht konzeptuelles Wissen zu erlernen. Direkte Instruktion ist hierfür meist effektiver. Die Forschungslage ist leider auch beim Problembasierten Lernen heterogen, allerdings scheint PBL auf die Lange Sicht besser zu funktionieren, konzeptuelles und prozedurales Wissen zu erwerben. Die Ergebnisse verdeutlichen, dass die Auswahl eines IDMs wiederum von den Zielen abhängig sind, die man verfolgt. Einschränkend müssen wir noch sagen, dass Problembasiertes LErnen verstärkt in der Medizin eingestzt wurde und die Ergebnisse eher von soclehn Domänen her zu interpretieren sind.

However,  a  recent  report  on  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  on  the  effec-tiveness  of  PBL  used  in  higher  education  programs  for  health  professionals  (Newman,  2003)  stated  that  “existing  overviews  of  the  field  do  not  provide  high  quality  evidence  with which to provide robust answers to questions about the effectiveness of PBL” (p. 5). Specifically  this  analysis  of  research  studies  attempted  to  compare  PBL  with  traditional  approaches to discover if PBL increased performance in adapting to and participating in change; dealing with problems and making reasoned decisions in unfamiliar situations; reasoning critically and creatively; adopting a more universal or holistic approach; practic-ing empathy, appreciating the other person’s point of view; collaborating productive

Over a similar time frame, the problem-based learning (PBL) approach has been widely adopted by undergraduate medical schools, in spite of empirical reviews suggesting that its effectiveness may be limited

Students claim that PBL provides a more satisfying learning experience than traditional methods. While such an outcome is desirable, it is substantively less than the original promise of the approach


kirschner epistemology vs. pedagogic

Six  reviews  of  PBL  have  been  published  in  the  past  decade.Norman and Schmidt’s10 1992 review found that students taughtwith  PBL  curricula  were  superior  in  knowledge  retention  butinferior  in  overall  knowledge  and  competence  when  comparedwith   students   taught   by   traditional   curricula.   Vernon   andBlake,11  in  their  1993  review,  concluded  that  PBL  students’attitudes,  class  attendance  and  mood  were  better  than  those  ofstudents   in   traditional   teaching   institutions.   Albanese   andMitchell12  reported  similar  findings.  Colliver’s8  2000  reviewconcluded  that,  although  some  studies  show  marginal  outcomeadvantages for students educated under PBL, there is no evidenceof  educational  superiority  to  the  extent  one  might  expect  giventhe resource-intensive nature of the PBL curriculum. The reviewby  Nandi  et  al13  in  the  same  year  concluded  that  PBL  studentsconsistently  find  their  course  more  enjoyable  and  demonstratebetter  interpersonal  skills  compared  with  traditionally  trainedstudents.  The  most  recent  review,  conducted  by  Newman14  in2003, indicated that PBL students report greater satisfaction andemploy more productive approaches to study. However, in termsof knowledge accumulation and practice-based outcomes, resultsfrom  the  articles  analysed  were  mixed,  with  some  showingbenefits  for  PBL  students  and  others  indicating  benefits  fortraditionally taught students.

n summarising the evidence to date, it appears that the mostconsistently demonstrated advantage of the PBL approach is thepersonal satisfaction of medical students engaged in this form oflearning and their superior interpersonal skills. The importancegiven  to  these  aspects  of  the  educational  process  is,  perhaps,  amatter of social and institutional values. One could speculate thata more enjoyable, formative educational experience may translateto a greater resilience when coping with potential difficulties inone’s professional life. However, testing such a hypothesis wouldbe  difficult.  Students  following  a  PBL  approach  consistentlygraduate with a knowledge of the basic sciences that is inferior to(or at most on a par with) that of students taught in traditionalcourses.9,10,15  PBL  may  be  more  effective  in  some  topic  areas,such  as  behavioural  sciences14 and psychiatry.16  The  amount  ofbasic science knowledge that is enough to equip an undergradu-ate to successfully and confidently function as a medical practi-tioner is unknown and would be difficult to determine
Evidence that PBL curricula lead to greater retention and recallof  information  and  a  strengthening  of  hypothetico-deductivereasoning  is  not  robust  and  is  mostly  absent  from  researchfindings. As this is one of the educational rationales for adoptinga   PBL   curriculum,   one   must   question   the   reasons   for   thecontinuing  growth  in  popularity  of  PBL. 

> PBL  is  seen  asmore democratic and humanistic: the individual’s voice is valued,and  students  are  no  longer  silent  receptors  of  knowledge  fromtheir superiors

. Studies on the effectiveness of PBL appear to be mixed, but have generally
shown that students who have experienced PBL
achieve similar or less learning gains when it comes
to short-term knowledge acquisition when compared to
students in a lecture-based learning environment

However, in terms of longer-term knowledge retention,
the results are significantly in PBL's favour

trobel and van Barneveld27 analysed a
number of meta-analyses on the effectiveness of PBL
and found that PBL is more effective than traditional
approaches when the measurement of learning outcomes focused on long-term knowledge retention,
performance or skill-based assessment and mixed
knowledge and skills. It was only when the focus
was on short-term knowledge acquisition and retention
that PBL appeared less effective. PBL therefore
appears to be a superior and effective strategy to “train
competent and skilled practitioners and to promote
long-term retention of knowledge and skills acquired
during the learning experience”

A meta-analysis of studies related to the
effectiveness of PBL in nursing education28 revealed
that PBL has positive effects on student satisfaction
with training, clinical education and skills development. Another review of related literature on the effect
of PBL on developing nursing students’ critical thinking29 showed a positive relationship between the
implementation of PBL as an instructional model and
improvements in critical reasoning. Many of these
studies are often localised, and their results and
methods—while not necessarily generalisable—provide some pedagogical value as guidelines for nurse
educators in considering training frameworks to design
and deliver healthcare curriculum. More rigorous
research is needed to further examine the effects of
PBL on student learning outcomes and performance in
both academic and workplace situations.

In conclusion, the studies reviewed above suggest
that PBL is an effective teaching and learning
approach, particularly when it is evaluated for longterm knowledge retention and applications. One gap in
earlier studies on the effectiveness of PBL is that the
studies tended to focus on medical education. However, there are now increasing number of experimental
studies in other disciplines that provide evidence of the
superior performance of students learning in PBL
conditions as opposed to lecture conditions -->
