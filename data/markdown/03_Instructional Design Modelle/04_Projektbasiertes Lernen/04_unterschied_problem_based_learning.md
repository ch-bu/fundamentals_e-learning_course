<multiplechoice question="Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Problembasiertem Lernen und Projektbasiertem Lernen?"></multiplechoice> -->



<!-- PBL  as  a  form  of  instruction  has  clear  connections  with  other  pedagogical  approaches,  such  as  problem-based learning among others (Helle, Tynjälä, & Olkinuora, 2006). The focus in both is for participants  to  achieve  a  shared  goal  through  collaboration.  In  their  engagement  with  a  project,  students can encounter problems which need to be addressed in order to construct and present the end  product  in  response  to  the  driving  question.  The  main  difference  between  the  two  is  that  whereas students in problem-based learning are primarily focused on the process of learning, PBL needs to culminate in an end product (see also Blumenfeld et al., 1991). PBL has also been com-pared  with  other  pedagogical  practices  such  as  experiential  or  collaborative  learning -->
